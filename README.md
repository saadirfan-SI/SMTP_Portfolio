# SMTP_Portfolio

# Note

We were given a started SMTP code that was written in python and the task was to send an email to an SMTP client. 
The next task was to send multiple emails to the an email address.
The final task was to send multiple emails to different email addresses.

I do not know a lot of python programming because i had not learnt it in firs year but since i had programming experience in Java and C, and knew programming logic
i therefore developed the code to complete the tasks.

The starter code was provided by the course professor.
